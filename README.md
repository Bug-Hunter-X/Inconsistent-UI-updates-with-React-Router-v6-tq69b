# Inconsistent UI Updates with React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using React Router v6, where the UI does not always update correctly when navigating between routes.  The issue manifests inconsistently, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The application uses `react-router-dom` v6 to handle navigation.  While navigating between routes, sometimes the UI fails to refresh completely, resulting in stale component data or incorrect rendering.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Navigate between the `/` (Home) and `/about` routes.
5. Observe that sometimes the UI doesn't correctly reflect the active route, retaining elements from the previous route.

## Potential Causes

The root cause of this behavior is suspected to be an issue in how React Router v6 handles component updates under certain conditions.   Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the precise circumstances that trigger the bug.
